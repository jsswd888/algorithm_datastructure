# algorithm_datastructure

This repository keeps track of my Leetcode question progress & couple implementation of learned data structures & algorithms 

## Leetcode

I am currently following the following link for leetcode sections:

`https://github.com/CyC2018/CS-Notes/blob/master/notes/Leetcode%20%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3%20-%20%E5%8F%8C%E6%8C%87%E9%92%88.md#3-%E5%8F%8D%E8%BD%AC%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%A6%E4%B8%B2%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E5%85%83%E9%9F%B3%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%A6`

6.20 update: double pointer one question left; rest section wait for update


## Data structure:

The current plan is to implement some data structures that have learned, e.g. rebuild of Dijikstra; perfect BST; 2,3,4 Tree; B-Tree; Hash Table/Map, etc.  


## NOTE about algorithm

Some popular algorithm is probably gonna included, e.g. BFS/DFS; A* searching; Greedy; etc.

The repository is actively updating.
